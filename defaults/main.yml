# Lifted from the `geerlingguy.certbot` role that this role is attempting
# to shim.
#
# By default, we'll set `self_signed_certs` to be whatever `certbot_certs` is,
# so that we can smoothly substitute this role for `geerlingguy.certbot`
# without changing inventory variables.  If this role is intended to be used
# directly, it will make more sense to ignore `certbot_certs` and set
# `self_signed_certs` directly.  This would allow, for example this role and
# `geerlingguy.certbot` to be installed at the same time.
